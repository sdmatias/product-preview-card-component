## My process

My process was first to write the HTML code with the corresponding semantics, then create the styles for mobile devices and finally with a media query I made the design for larger devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned a new and modern way to reset CSS margins. Also the importance of mobile first design.

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

body,
main,
img,
p,
h1,
span,
del,
button,
svg,
footer {
    margin: 0;
}

html:focus-within {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

body {
    min-height: 100vh !important;
    text-rendering: optimizeSpeed;
    line-height: 1.5;
}

img {
    max-width: 100%;
    display: block;
}

button {
    font: inherit;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue strengthening my design skills for different screen sizes. I'm still not comfortable with that part of the design and it's taking longer than I expect.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/) - This article helped me change my outdated CSS margin reset to a more modern one.
- [Uso correcto de ID attribute](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/id-attribute-masterclass/) - Here I found help to understand the correct use of IDs in HTML.
